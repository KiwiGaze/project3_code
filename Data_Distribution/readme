To use .ipynb You should clone our github repo to your own Github repo, and the reposity could be 'project3_code' if you clone the whole repo as your repo. 
Remember to change other code here to your own github profile. After execute every line of code in our .ipynb, you should see a similar result in our paper.
    
    ```
    username = 'Your_github_name'
    git_token = 'your_github_token'
    repository = 'where_you_store_our_github_repository'
    !git clone https://{git_token}@github.com/{username}/{repository}
    ```
